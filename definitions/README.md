# MS45.1 Definition Files

## Tuner Pro

Definition files have been taken from the [MS4x Wiki Definitions Page](https://www.ms4x.net/index.php?title=Definition_Files#Siemens_MS45.1). As of writing this, the only firmware version with definition files appears to be 457LO02S. If your ECU is not already installed with this firmware you will need to update. The update process is better documented [here](../firmware).

## ROM Raider

Although I am using Tuner Pro, there is a ROM Raider fourm on the MS45.x DME which has links to definition files.
