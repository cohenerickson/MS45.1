# Updated firmware

So far XDF Definitions are only available for firmware version 457LO02S on the MS45.1.

This means that in order to properly modify tables we need to upgrade/downgrade to this version.

Updating can be done through WinKFP, the process is documented [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rlHr2qU__g).

If WinKFP doesn't automatically select the correct version for you ECU you may need to use the table found on the [ms4x wiki](https://www.ms4x.net/index.php?title=Firmware_Files#Siemens_MS45.1) to determine the correct version.

The files above were read with [MS45 Quickflash](https://www.bimmertuningtools.com/product/ms45-quickflash/) after the update was complete.
